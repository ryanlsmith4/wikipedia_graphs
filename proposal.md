# Proposal for the CS 2.2 graph project.

## Description
 We have all heard that it only takes so many clicks on wikipedia to reach philosophy. I plan to

 [] find the shorest path to philosphy from an arbitrary access point. 

[] find the average edges it takes to reach philosophy.

[] be able to find the shortest path between two nodes on wikipedia.
